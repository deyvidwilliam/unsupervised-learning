# Unsupervised machine learning using K-Means clustering

Unsupervised learning means that there is no outcome to be predicted, and the algorithm just tries to find patterns in the data. 
K Means Clustering is an unsupervised learning algorithm that tries to cluster data based on their similarity. 

The dataset chosen was the *Chatterjee-Price Attitude Data* which is a sample R dataset from the library(datasets) package. It is a survey of clerical employees of a large financial organization and the data are aggregated from the questionnaires of the approximately 35 employees for each of 30 departments.

Writing, editing and compositing this exercise was done using RStudio available as a docker image at Docker Hub:
